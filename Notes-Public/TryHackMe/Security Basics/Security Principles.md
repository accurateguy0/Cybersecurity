- The Clark-Wilson Model

### Bell-LaPadula Model

The Bell-LaPadula Model aims to achieve **confidentiality** by specifying three rules:

- **Simple Security Property** : This property is referred to as “no read up”; it states that a subject at a lower security level cannot read an object at a higher security level. This rule prevents access to sensitive information above the authorized level.
- **Star Security Property** : This property is referred to as “no write down”; it states that a subject at a higher security level cannot write to an object at a lower security level. This rule prevents the disclosure of sensitive information to a subject of lower security level.
- **Discretionary-Security Property** : This property uses an access matrix to allow read and write operations. An example access matrix is shown in the table below and used in conjunction with the first two properties.

|Subjects|Object A|Object B|
|---|---|---|
|Subject 1|Write|No access|
|Subject 2|Read/Write|Read|

The first two properties can be summarized as “write up, read down.” You can share confidential information with people of higher security clearance (write up), and you can receive confidential information from people with lower security clearance (read down).

There are certain limitations to the Bell-LaPadula model. For example, it was not designed to handle file-sharing.

### Biba Model

The Biba Model aims to achieve **integrity** by specifying two main rules:

- **Simple Integrity Property** : This property is referred to as “no read down”; a higher integrity subject should not read from a lower integrity object.
- **Star Integrity Property** : This property is referred to as “no write up”; a lower integrity subject should not write to a higher integrity object.

These two properties can be summarized as “read up, write down.” This rule is in contrast with the Bell-LaPadula Model, and this should not be surprising as one is concerned with confidentiality while the other is with integrity.

Biba Model suffers from various limitations. One example is that it does not handle internal threats (insider threat).

### Clark-Wilson Model

The Clark-Wilson Model also aims to achieve integrity by using the following concepts:

- **Constrained Data Item (CDI)** : This refers to the data type whose integrity we want to preserve.
- **Unconstrained Data Item (UDI)** : This refers to all data types beyond CDI, such as user and system input.
- **Transformation Procedures (TPs)** : These procedures are programmed operations, such as read and write, and should maintain the integrity of CDIs.
- **Integrity Verification Procedures (IVPs)** : These procedures check and ensure the validity of CDIs.

We covered only three security models. The reader can explore many additional security models. Examples include:

- Brewer and Nash model
- Goguen-Meseguer model
- Sutherland model
- Graham-Denning model
- Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman model

The security of a system is attacked through one of several means. It can be via the disclosure of secret data, alteration of data, or destruction of data.

- **Disclosure** is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
- **Alteration** is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable.
- **Destruction/Denial** is the opposite of Availability.

The opposite of the CIA Triad would be the DAD Triad: Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction.

Consider the previous example of patient records and related systems:

- Disclosure: As in most modern countries, healthcare providers must maintain medical records’ confidentiality. As a result, if an attacker succeeds in stealing some of these medical records and dumping them online to be viewed publicly, the health care provider will incur a loss due to this data disclosure attack.
- Alteration: Consider the gravity of the situation if the attacker manages to modify patient medical records. This alteration attack might lead to the wrong treatment being administered, and consequently, this alteration attack could be life-threatening.
- Destruction/Denial: Consider the case where a medical facility has gone completely paperless. If an attacker manages to make the database systems unavailable, the facility will not be able to function properly. They can go back to paper temporarily; however, the patient records won’t be available. This denial attack would stall the whole facility.

Before we can describe something as _secure_, we need to consider better what makes up security. When you want to judge the security of a system, you need to think in terms of the security triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).

- **Confidentiality** ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
- **Integrity** aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
- **Availability** aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.
Going one more step beyond the CIA security triad, we can think of:

- **Authenticity**: Authentic means not fraudulent or counterfeit. Authenticity is about ensuring that the document/file/data is from the claimed source.
- **Nonrepudiation**: Repudiate means refusing to recognize the validity of something. Nonrepudiation ensures that the original source cannot deny that they are the source of a particular document/file/data. This characteristic is indispensable for various domains, such as shopping, patient diagnosis, and banking.
### Parkerian Hexad

In 1998, Donn Parker proposed the Parkerian Hexad, a set of six security elements. They are:

1. Availability
2. Utility
3. Integrity
4. Authenticity
5. Confidentiality
6. Possession

We have already covered four of the above six elements. Let's discuss the remaining two elements:

- **Utility**: Utility focuses on the usefulness of the information. For instance, a user might have lost the decryption key to access a laptop with encrypted storage. Although the user still has the laptop with its disk(s) intact, they cannot access them. In other words, although still available, the information is in a form that is not useful, i.e., of no utility.
- **Possession**: This security element requires that we protect the information from unauthorized taking, copying, or controlling. For instance, an adversary might take a backup drive, meaning we lose possession of the information as long as they have the drive. Alternatively, the adversary might succeed in encrypting our data using ransomware; this also leads to the loss of possession of the data.
